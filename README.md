# Funda-project-2019

Project for Fundamentals of Data analysis at Galway - Mayo Institute of Technology. The aim of this project is to look into "Tips" dataset and show its features through Python packages, seaborn and Jupyter.

# Tips dataset

Dataset consists of 244 cases which were recorded by a food server during an interval of two and half months in early 1990. Each record includes a day and time, and taken together they show the serverâ€™s work schedule. There are 7 variables used in a dataset:

1. the price of total bill in US dollars, including tax.

2. tip given to the waiter, also in US dollars.

3. the sex of customers. The waiter recorded only the sex of customer who paid for the bill (0 = male, 1 = female)

4. it was recorded if there were any smokers in party (0 = Yes, 1 = No)

5. day of the visit. The waiter recorded tips only taken from Thursday to Sunday (3 = Thur, 4 = Fri, 5 = Sat, 6 = Sun)

6. time of the day the customers left the restaurant (0 = Day, 1 = Night). 

7. the size of the party.


# Seaborn

Seaborn is a library for making statistical graphics in Python. It is built on top of matplotlib and closely integrated with pandas data structures.

Here is some of the functionality that seaborn offers:

- A dataset-oriented API for examining relationships between multiple variables
- Specialized support for using categorical variables to show observations or aggregate statistics
- Options for visualizing univariate or bivariate distributions and for comparing them between subsets of data
- Automatic estimation and plotting of linear regression models for different kinds dependent variables
- Convenient views onto the overall structure of complex datasets
- High-level abstractions for structuring multi-plot grids that let you easily build complex visualizations
- Concise control over matplotlib figure styling with several built-in themes
- Tools for choosing color palettes that faithfully reveal patterns in your data

Seaborn aims to make visualization a central part of exploring and understanding data. Its dataset-oriented plotting functions operate on dataframes and arrays containing whole datasets and internally perform the necessary semantic mapping and statistical aggregation to produce informative plots.For more information about seaborn go to: https://seaborn.pydata.org/introduction.html

# Jupyter

The Jupyter Notebook is an open-source web application that allows you to create and share documents that contain live code, equations, visualizations and narrative text. Uses include: data cleaning and transformation, numerical simulation, statistical modeling, data visualization, machine learning, and much more.

To install your jupyter notebook, you have to:

1. Enter the startup folder by typing cd /folder_name .
2. Run jupyter notebook command to launch the Jupyter Notebook App. The notebook interface will appear in a new browser window or tab.
3. In the top right corner press New, Python 3 to open new file in jupyter
4. Click ESC and key shortcut m to markdown or double click the text in the cell if you want to edit. 
5. You can run the notebook document step-by-step (one cell a time) by pressing shift + enter.
6. You can run the whole notebook in a single step by clicking on the menu Cell -> Run All.
7. Closing the browser (or the tab) will not close the Jupyter Notebook App. To completely shut it down you need to close the associated terminal.
